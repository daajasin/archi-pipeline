# Creating/ Improving the ArchiOPS-pipeline

Trying to use the devops methodology in architecture
How can workflow in the architecture pipeline be fastracked and improved upon?
What are some of the areas that need to be developed or improved upon

What are the things that take time?
Searching for code? and city requirements?
What are some of the things that can be done just by information.?
Type of project? Information about the project can help?
This can be containerirized like docker, that will bake the requirements of a project into a file.
That can be deployed everytime you make start a new project

** Use planning book to get this out there.
Building heights
type of construction
Occupancies
Wall types


Create a resource for building in Nigeria.
Planning offices across the country...



# Concept:
It is basically a website that will interface with the city and make it give you all the requirements you need to get your projects approved in the shortest amount of time
This will create templates for AutoCAD or Revit that will input all the requirements for the site
you will then use the points indicated in the file to create your project.
The check marks will be red and will turn green when they are passed by the architect office.

If all the checks are green, it will be indicated on the cover page and then when submitted by the city it will be passed automatically.

 This will be initiated by the city and then introduced to the architect, who will use it in their projects.


2. The excell sheet in google will allow you to enter some queries for jurisdictions and then it will be fetched to your excel sheet.
This will then give you the idea


Get the main objective clear...
making the city have a template for their zoning and 

What this project is not and what it is

Fetching templates from the city website about the requirements for something
